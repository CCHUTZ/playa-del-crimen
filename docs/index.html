            <h2>Welcome to the Crime Beach</h2>
            <p><strong>Playa del Crimen</strong> is an educational project designed to teach OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), threat intelligence, and sociotechnical security through immersive, narrative-driven training scenarios. This is not your typical cybersecurity course. Here, you will learn to think like a threat actor, understand the human element of security, and build better defenses by exploring realistic, fictional case studies.</p>
            <p>Our philosophy is simple: the best way to learn defense is to understand offense. Each scenario is a deep dive into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by real-world threat actors, presented in a safe and ethical educational environment.</p>
