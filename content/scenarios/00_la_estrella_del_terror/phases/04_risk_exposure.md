# Phase 4: Risk Exposure

**Objective:** To simulate the impact of an information operation on the organization.

## The Operation

In this phase, the intelligence team would execute a simulated information operation. This could involve:

- **Leaking compromising information** to the media or law enforcement.
- **Sowing discord** within the organization by selectively releasing information to different factions.
- **Creating a pretext** that causes the organization to take actions that are against its own interests.

## The Impact

The goal is not to cause technical damage, but to create a **reputational crisis** that leads to:

- **Loss of legitimacy:** The organization is no longer seen as a credible or trustworthy entity.
- **Internal conflict:** The members of the organization turn on each other.
- **Institutional intervention:** The government or other external actors are forced to step in.

## Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs)

- What is the most damaging information that could be revealed?
- Who are the key audiences for the information operation?
- What are the likely second- and third-order effects of the operation?

## Expected Outcome

A detailed after-action report that analyzes the simulated impact of the information operation and provides recommendations for how the organization could have defended itself.
