# Phase 3: Relationship Modeling

**Objective:** To visualize the hidden networks of power and influence.

## Activities

- **Build Influence Graphs:** Create a visual representation of the social network, with nodes representing individuals and edges representing relationships.
- **Analyze Centrality:** Identify the most influential individuals in the network using metrics like betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.
- **Map Information Flows:** Trace the path of information through the network to identify bottlenecks, gatekeepers, and super-spreaders.

## Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs)

- Who are the key brokers of information in the network?
- Who are the most trusted individuals?
- Are there any isolated groups or individuals?
- How would the removal of a key individual impact the rest of the network?

## Expected Outcome

A set of social network analysis graphs that provide a deep understanding of the informal structure of the organization.
