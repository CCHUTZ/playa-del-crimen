# Phase 1: Sociotechnical Reconnaissance

**Objective:** To understand the human environment of the system.

## Activities

- **Identify Key Actors:** Who are the formal and informal leaders? Who are the influencers, the gatekeepers, and the dissenters?
- **Map Informal Networks:** How does information *really* flow within the organization? What are the unofficial channels of communication?
- **Analyze Organizational Culture:** What are the shared values, beliefs, and behaviors? Is the culture one of trust, fear, or apathy?

## Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs)

- Who holds the most influence, regardless of their official title?
- What are the primary communication channels used for day-to-day operations?
- Are there any known internal conflicts or grievances?
- What are the external dependencies of the organization (e.g., political connections, business partners)?

## Expected Outcome

A detailed map of the human landscape of the organization, including a list of key individuals, a diagram of the informal communication networks, and an assessment of the organizational culture.
