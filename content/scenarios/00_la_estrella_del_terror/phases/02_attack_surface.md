# Phase 2: Human Attack Surface Analysis

**Objective:** To identify the specific human vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

## Vulnerabilities to Look For

- **Excessive Digital Trust:** Do members of the organization blindly trust digital communications?
- **Unofficial Channels:** Are critical business discussions happening on personal devices or unmonitored platforms?
- **Lack of Information Verification:** Is there a culture of questioning and verifying information, or is it accepted at face value?
- **Dependence on Informal Leadership:** Does the organization rely on a few key individuals to make decisions and disseminate information?

## Key Intelligence Questions (KIQs)

- What is the general level of security awareness among the members?
- Are there any established procedures for verifying the identity of individuals or the authenticity of communications?
- Who has access to the most sensitive information, and how is that access controlled?
- What are the common psychological biases that could be exploited (e.g., urgency, authority, social proof)?

## Expected Outcome

A prioritized list of human vulnerabilities, along with potential attack vectors for each.
