# Scenario 00: La Estrella del Terror

**Welcome to your first assignment.**

This scenario will immerse you in the world of sociotechnical intelligence operations. Your mission is to understand how a sophisticated threat actor could dismantle a powerful, informal organization by exploiting its human vulnerabilities.

**This is not a technical hacking exercise.** This is an intelligence exercise. Your goal is to learn to see the world through the eyes of a threat analyst, to understand the power of information, and to recognize that the most critical vulnerabilities are often not in the code, but in the culture.
