# Briefing: Operation Starfish

**Classification:** Educational // Fictional

**Codename:** La Estrella del Terror (The Terror Starfish)

## 1. Situation

**Location:** Playa del Crimen (a fictional, picturesque Caribbean tourist hub).

**Target:** A powerful, semi-formal taxi union that controls the local transportation market. The union operates as a hybrid entity: a legitimate business on the surface, but with deep-rooted informal power structures, and alleged ties to criminal activities.

**Key Intelligence Gap:** The formal structure of the union is well-documented, but the informal power dynamics, financial flows, and decision-making processes are opaque. The organization relies heavily on informal communication channels (e.g., WhatsApp groups, face-to-face meetings) and a culture of loyalty and fear.

## 2. Mission

Your mission is to conduct a simulated sociotechnical intelligence operation to:

1.  **Map the informal power structure** of the taxi union.
2.  **Identify key vulnerabilities** in their human and communication systems.
3.  **Simulate an information operation** to expose the union's alleged illicit activities, leading to its organizational collapse.

**The primary objective is not technical exploitation, but strategic information dominance.**

## 3. Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this scenario, you will be able to:

- **Define and identify** a sociotechnical attack surface.
- **Conduct a human-centric OSINT investigation** to map an informal organization.
- **Analyze and model** trust relationships and influence networks.
- **Design a pretexting campaign** to elicit sensitive information.
- **Understand the principles** of information warfare and its impact on organizational stability.
- **Develop defensive strategies** to protect your own organization from similar threats.

## 4. Rules of Engagement

- All activities are to be conducted within the fictional context of this scenario.
- No real-world systems or individuals are to be targeted.
- The focus is on analysis, strategy, and defensive thinking.
