# Practical Defense Exercise: Defending Your Organization

**Objective:** To apply the defensive principles learned in this scenario to your own organization.

## The Scenario

Imagine that you are the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of your organization. You have just learned about the "La Estrella del Terror" scenario, and you are concerned that your organization could be vulnerable to a similar attack. Your mission is to develop a plan to defend your organization against a sophisticated sociotechnical attack.

## Your Tasks

2.  **Develop a defense-in-depth strategy:** Design a multi-layered defense that includes technical controls, administrative controls, and physical controls.
3.  **Create a security awareness and training program:** Educate your employees on how to recognize and respond to social engineering attacks.
4.  **Develop an incident response plan:** Create a plan for how your organization will respond to a sociotechnical attack.
