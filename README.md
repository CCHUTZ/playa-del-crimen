# Playa del Crimen

**OSINT Training Scenarios**

---

## Welcome to the Crime Beach

**Playa del Crimen** is an educational project designed to teach OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), threat intelligence, and sociotechnical security through immersive, narrative-driven training scenarios. This is not your typical cybersecurity course. Here, you will learn to think like a threat actor, understand the human element of security, and build better defenses by exploring realistic, fictional case studies.

Our philosophy is simple: the best way to learn defense is to understand offense. Each scenario is a deep dive into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by real-world threat actors, presented in a safe and ethical educational environment.

## What You Will Learn

- **The Intelligence Analyst's Mindset:** How to approach complex problems with a structured, analytical, and creative mindset.
- **Sociotechnical Risk:** How to identify and mitigate risks that arise from the interaction between people, processes, and technology.
- **OSINT Techniques:** How to gather and analyze publicly available information to build a comprehensive intelligence picture.
- **Social Engineering:** How to recognize and defend against the psychological manipulation tactics used by attackers.
- **Threat Modeling:** How to anticipate and prepare for potential threats to your organization.

## Who Is This For?

- **Cybersecurity Professionals:** Sharpen your OSINT and threat intelligence skills.
- **Intelligence Analysts:** Apply your analytical tradecraft to the cyber domain.
- **Red Teamers & Pentesters:** Get new ideas for realistic, human-centric attack scenarios.
- **Security Educators:** Use our scenarios as ready-made tabletop exercises for your own training programs.
- **Business Leaders:** Understand the real-world risks that your organization faces in the digital age.

## Our Approach

We believe that learning should be engaging, memorable, and effective. That's why we've adopted a unique "Beach Noir" aesthetic, combining the seriousness of intelligence work with the style and atmosphere of a Caribbean thriller. Each scenario is a story, and you are the protagonist.
